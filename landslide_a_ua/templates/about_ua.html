In this project two approaches are used for the assessment and predictions of landslide hazards. </p>
                                <p class="text1"> The outcome of the assessment would be the measurement of an impact of these processes on the building, transport, recreational infrastructure. This research addresses the  areas of “sustainable cities and communities” and “resilience and action on short-term environmental shocks and long-term environmental change”. It will enable the fundamental research tools developed at City to be strategically deployed to tackle the challenges and the destructive effects of landslides.  Simultaneously, it will investigate socio-cultural effects on the perception of risk to develop more efficient and robust mitigation systems. </p>
                                <p class="text1">Training students in using geophysical, geotechnical, geological and geoinformation methods and equipment to resolve ecological and monitoring geohazards task are planning.  </p>
